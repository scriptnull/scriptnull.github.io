                <p>A few years back (around 2013), when I was still in college I started noticing few people sharing links to very interesting projects in my facebook feed. All the links pointed to this site called <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>. I was thrilled to open and read the README.md files every time I get the link to a project.</p>

<p>During those days, the best place to get software was <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a>. At first, I didn&rsquo;t quite get what GitHub is. But after I saw a lot of people sharing links to the same website, I dug in deep. It led me to a lot of things like understanding what Open Source Software is, a new way of writing called Markdown etc.</p>

<p>I was very much interested in building real-world software when I was in college and I wanted to somehow learn to use this thing called GitHub and experience &ldquo;Social Coding&rdquo;. So, I finally signed up and decided to start off something. I was learning Java during that time and taught of uploading the code that I practiced to GitHub and created this repository called <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/javaConcepts">javaConcepts</a>. I even had Twitter hook in Github, which tweets every single commit on that repository (haha, fancy me).</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[javaConcepts] <a href="https://t.co/tQYmTo2Uqi">https://t.co/tQYmTo2Uqi</a> Vishnu Bharathi - Hello World Commit</p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/390886649275887617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I vividly remember using the Github GUI client for Windows and I used it for a long time and never really preferred the command line git until I got into Linux (where I was forced to). I liked the Github for Windows software. It was white and clean.</p>

<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t know a lot of things (like git, java etc.), I kept on going. I wrote code, committed and pushed day by day, without turning back or thinking if someone was watching. I just did it. I don&rsquo;t know how, but I guess the curiosity and my interest to learn things took me way more forward than any other thing. Coding became one of my passions. But I liked it and I still do.</p>
