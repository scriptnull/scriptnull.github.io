      <description>This document is an exercise from the book named &amp;ldquo;Designing Your Life: Build the Perfect Career, Step by Step&amp;rdquo; by Bill Burnett &amp;amp; Dave Evans
My thoughts on work? hmm, let me think.
Damn, this is hard. Mind is so vague and I doubt myself highly to complete this document

      <description>After deciding to learn about the JVM, I started reading the JVM specification. I felt the need for trying out few things on my machine to get some practical idea about what the specification tries to tell.
I am currently reading the Chapter 2: The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine. Here is what I got to learn.
Java Virtual Machine Specification The first line states
 This document specifies an abstract machine.</description>

      <description>Today I made a firm choice. The choice that &amp;ldquo;I would dig deep into something and learn about it in detail&amp;rdquo;.
The Advice A few years back when I was still in college, I and my friend used to program in a computer science lab that was located near to the office of our teachers. Some teachers drop by sometime and speak with us about various things. Sometimes it would be about the cool new JavaScript framework that we are using in our project and sometimes it would just be about an interesting TV series or movie.</description>

      <description>A few years back (around 2013), when I was still in college I started noticing few people sharing links to very interesting projects in my facebook feed. All the links pointed to this site called github.com. I was thrilled to open and read the README.md files every time I get the link to a project.
During those days, the best place to get software was sourceforge. At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what GitHub is.</description>
