      <description>A few years back (around 2013), when I was still in college I started noticing few people sharing links to very interesting projects in my facebook feed. All the links pointed to this site called github.com. I was thrilled to open and read the README.md files every time I get the link to a project.
During those days, the best place to get software was sourceforge. At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what GitHub is.</description>
