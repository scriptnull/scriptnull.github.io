First of all, the structure of the JVM is itself a beauty.</description>

      <description>After deciding to learn about the JVM, I started reading the JVM specification. I felt the need for trying out few things on my machine to get some practical idea about what the specification tries to tell.
I am currently reading the Chapter 2: The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine. Here is what I got to learn.
Java Virtual Machine Specification The first line states
 This document specifies an abstract machine.</description>
