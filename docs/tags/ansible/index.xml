      <description>I used ansible at work few months back. Today, I faced a problem at work, trying to connect to a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform created with ansible. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel surprised, when I was not able to be productive on it immediately, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn ansible as much as I learnt terraform. I learnt both of them using the docs. If you ask me to do something dealing with multiple machines, I would probably prefer terraform over ansible.</description>
