      <description>Ever since I decided to learn about the Java Ecosystem, I have been wanting to try out something practical. May be write a small app in Java and see how the experience would be. I came across a framework called Eclipse Vert.x few months back and decided to give it a try. So I ended up reading its documentation for few weekends and today morning. I am feeling a bit comfortable to write some code on Vert.</description>

      <description>I am glad that I am continuing my journey of reading the JVM specification and learning about it. If you had missed the first part of this series, you can read it from here. I read the Chapter 2: The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine last night and I came across quite some interesting and basic things.
First of all, the structure of the JVM is itself a beauty.</description>

      <description>After deciding to learn about the JVM, I started reading the JVM specification. I felt the need for trying out few things on my machine to get some practical idea about what the specification tries to tell.
I am currently reading the Chapter 2: The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine. Here is what I got to learn.
Java Virtual Machine Specification The first line states
 This document specifies an abstract machine.</description>

      <description>Today I made a firm choice. The choice that &amp;ldquo;I would dig deep into something and learn about it in detail&amp;rdquo;.
The Advice A few years back when I was still in college, I and my friend used to program in a computer science lab that was located near to the office of our teachers. Some teachers drop by sometime and speak with us about various things. Sometimes it would be about the cool new JavaScript framework that we are using in our project and sometimes it would just be about an interesting TV series or movie.</description>
