Today, I attended [GIDS18](http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/) (Great Indian Developer Summit). It spans 5 days with following topics covered.

- Web & Mobile
- Java & Dynamic Lang
- Data & Cloud
- Devops & Architecture
- Deep Dive

I thought of attending one day and learn about the trends in a specific topic. From my [previous post](/blog/visit-the-old-to-understand-the-new/) you might have already guessed which one I had chosen.

I went for __Java & Dynamic Lang__!

It was a great snack for my new obsession about JVM. I got to explore and learn about various programming languages that rely on the JVM. However, I didn't get a chance to learn solely about the JVM in detail.

I strongly felt that the Java community is very mature than the last time I visited it (2 years back - 2015ish). It is now having amazing and very careful improvements to the language like [lambdas](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html) for example. Other than that I see a lot of frameworks like [Akka](https://akka.io/), [vertx](https://vertx.io/) etc. They are all heavily abstracted and the speakers were keen on how it makes life easy for everybody.

That's good. But, I guess I will still stick with [visiting the old to understand the new](/blog/visit-the-old-to-understand-the-new/). I am pretty sure that if I spend time with the documentation of those highly abstracted libraries, I would end up getting the idea of some uses cases but I am too afraid that I would never be able to learn and know what is really going on. (This fear is a reality in case of Node.js for me and it is a topic of its own to visit someday).

Some of the talks I liked are

- __"Do Not Walk Away from Complexity, Run"__ - [Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/venkat_s) : I am waiting for the video to be available on Youtube. This has a lot of nice things for programmers to keep in mind.
- __"Revisiting Effective Java in 2018"__ - [Edson Yanaga](https://twitter.com/yanaga) : This talk totally got me into adding the [Effective Java book](https://www.amazon.in/Effective-Java-Programming-Language-Guide-ebook/dp/B00B8V09HY?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=062a1964-6c73-4d54-971f-3676b7bd56ad&ref_=nav_signin&) to my wishlist.
- __"Asynchronous Programming with Kotlin"__ - [Hadi Hariri](https://twitter.com/hhariri) : I tried out Kotlin when it was in very early stages. It was not really usable for many things at that time. It is amazing to see a language come this far and flourish. I learnt about Coroutines, which are pretty much like Go routines.
- __"Seriously, Use Groovy NOW"__ - [Kenneth Kousen](https://twitter.com/kenkousen?lang=en) : Got a taste of Groovy for the first time. It feels pretty much like JavaScript, but it could be seen as an enhanced Java with opinionated defaults.
- __"A new Asynchronous Database Access API"__ - [Rajesh Tiwary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshtiwary/) : Got an idea about JDBC which makes synchronous calls and blocks the thread and whereas a new standard which they call it ADBA (Asynchronous Database Access API) for accessing Databases asynchronously.

My entire notes for the day is 6 lines.

Hmm, well. It went well.
