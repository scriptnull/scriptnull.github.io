Today, I am trying to learn about various sorting techniques in computing. I kind of procasinate over starting to learn about sorting whenever I am preparing for interviews. Mainly due to the fact that, we need to memorize the working of various soring algorithms. But over the time, I have came to a realization that each sorting algorithm is based on some intution and if we are able to understand those intutions, then it becomes easy to remember how they work.

One of my earliest attempts at learning about sorting algorithms is by writing [machinepack-sort](http://node-machine.org/machinepack-sort)

I am going to do a similar effort here, but this time I am planning to do these steps.
1. Understand and visualize how a sort algorithm works. (by reading blogs, seeing video tutorials and lectures)
1. Come up with the time and space complexity for each of them.
1. Write code and test the implementation using [this leetcode puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
1. Try to find practical use cases for each algorithm.

I hope to document each of the above stages below.

# Preface
I will try to collect information that might clarify details for understanding the sorting algorithms in this section. A fair warning: we will also use this section to put some spoilers like "the commonly used sorting algorithm"

## Stable Sorting

## Non-decreasing order

# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort
