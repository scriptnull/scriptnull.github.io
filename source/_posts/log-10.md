My 10th weekly log

### Birthday

First day of the week is my birthday. I am going to gift myself the perfect gift.

I opted in for Work from home today. Obviously, I don’t want to celebrate my birthday with random people on BMTC for 2 hours in morning or with random people on ride sharing service with weird songs being played in the background for 2 hours.

I started the day by reading the history of UNIX systems in [LPI](https://www.amazon.in/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook-ebook/dp/B004OEJMZM?tag=googinhydr18418-21). What a perfect way to start off the day!

### Focusing on Golang

I also had the pleasure of going through some golang stuff. Few months back I completed read the book called [“The Go Programming Language”](https://www.amazon.in/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440). If you have been following my logs, [I also publicly announced that I am picking up Crystal Programming language](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-1-0-3bb0ca07f6ab). So, My mind had been oscillating back and forth between these two languages.

I arrived at a point, where I need to choose between these two. I tend to go with Golang for now. I took this decision due to few reasons ( Which I might tell some other time ).

Crystal is an awesome programming language, but at this point of time it’s not mature enough. That does not mean I am abandoning Crystal. I will be constantly in watch for improvements to it ( like Windows support, better editor support etc. ) and always intrigued of what is possible with the tooling and language.

### Playing with Linux

I am super excited to learn about stuff in Linux from LPI. I will keep the tweets coming in!

### Barbecue

Eating at Absolute Barbecue had been in my checklist for a long time. Finally it happened. [My friend](https://twitter.com/argon_laser) and I had dinner on a Friday night. This time, I chose Vegetarian food, as I have been eating non-vegetarian food all over the week.

### View from friend’s home

After the dinner, I went [Venkat’s home](https://twitter.com/argon_laser) and stayed till Saturday evening.

### Powershell

I got the chance to work with powershell at work. I have to say, it’s pretty nice! I will try to explore it more as I move on.

I also noticed that powershell tries to play nice for bash users, due to the presence of commands like pushd, popd etc.

Thanks for reading. I quote verses from my favourite Tamil literature “[Tirukkuṛaḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)” at the end of my blog posts.
> # “பணிவுடையன் இன்சொலன் ஆதல் ஒருவற்கு

Translated meaning ( in my words ): Modesty and the habit of speaking good words add true beauty to a person and nothing else could beautify a person more.
