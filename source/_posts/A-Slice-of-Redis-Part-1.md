I just ordered a slice of cake and I was confused about the title of this post, hence "A Slice of Redis".

This is my attempt to learn about Redis in more detail and probably contribute something towards if I see a chance for it.

I have been longing to have this kind of session for a long time. Take a software that you absolutely love using and read it's code. Redis is one of my favorite softwares and I guess it is a good start.

Yes! I will try to read stuff inside the Redis development repository and learn things from it.

Here is a link to the repo; go do it if you are excited too.

By the way, expect to adventure a lot of  C code. Because Redis is written in C.
