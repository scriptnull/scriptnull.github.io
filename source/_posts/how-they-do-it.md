When it comes to applying for a new job, I have always been taking a different route instead of the common approach that people suggest often. (well, this blog post is not going to be about that. But about something that most of the software engineers are forced to do as part of preparing for their technical interviews)

The common adivse, that I keep getting is "Apply for as much as companies as possible". Play the numbers game.

I have been suggesting/doing something counter-intutive, "Research about a lot of companies + roles, but apply only to a handful of them"

Whenever I want to apply for a new job, I would just get so excited and spend at least a few minutes to hours researching about the company and the role. Those crisp company landing pages, cheerful career pages, and the "do I have what it takes?" job descriptions.

I try to get a genuine feel of what it would be like to work on this new job. If that feels right, only then I wish to apply.

Suprisingly, Eventhough I have a bunch of companies (my dream jobs) I had applied to a very very few of them (may be 1 out of 10).

haha, why? Fear. Just the fear of I am not prepared for the interview yet. What If I fail the interview etc. thoughts that potentially scare me.

When having a full-time job already, it might take a while for you to get the heat and start the job-lookout phase. For me this heating up period seems to be high, as a result of which I feel burnt out and kind of get distracted.

I wonder how people do it?

## reduce

From my understanding, the current state of preparing for interviews is like [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) function found in some programming languages.

You take an array of topics and call a learn/revise/practice function on them to reduce it to one result - that is whether you get a new job or not.

lol, sorry for doing this (comparing a function in programming to real-world stuff). I know that it could become pretty boring sometimes, when I speak like that :D

Ok, now hear me out.

Each array item has a topic like "linked list", "stacks", "system design" etc. which we need to learn through to apply for a new job.

For people like me, you tend to burnout before we reduce the array and not happen to call `reduce` for quite sometime afterwards in their career :D

I have been thinking about it for a while. I think the reason for this is the very nature of tools out there that help you prepare for these interviews.

## Tools
I am going to list down various tools available for preparing for technical interviews, what they have and not have that make them add to the burnt incurred during the interview preparation process.
