My 7th weekly log.

### Graphs

I happened to read 2 pages about graphs and I am felt very intrigued about the applications of it and occurrence of it in open source code bases. Of course, I didn’t go deep into this research, but I am gradually entering that lane.

### Graph Databases

There are databases, where the data is modelled as a graph instead of typical SQL tables and NoSQL documents. Examples for a graph database are [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), [cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley), [dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph). All of the three are open sourced. I would like to try using them and model a software with graphs. Of course, I am looking forward for reading the code within the above mentioned databases and love to see the implementation of graph within those softwares.

### Dinner on terrace

My friend and I happen to eat dinner at one of the nice places this week. I like places where we get to eat in the terrace.

### GraphQL

Speaking of graphs, one of the technology that I heard of often and did not really have the chance to visit is GraphQL. It’s a specification like REST for building web applications. I am going to try to find the answer for my simple question “Why is GraphQL called GraphQL?”. I think, this is the right place to start for me. I will go and dig GraphQL a bit now!

My bad, I didn’t have much time to learn more about GraphQL this week. But, however all I could say about it is you get to access information with less number of calls to the server. It is clearly the solution to solve the “n+1 requests” problem that I face at [work](https://www.shippable.com/)!

“n+1 requests” problem is the problem in which one API request leads to another API request and so on…. until all the information needed by the client are fetched. This problem usually occurs when using REST APIs with data being stored on a highly [normalised database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

### Just tired

For some reason, I feel very tired these days. I just feel like time is moving a lot faster. Probably because I am spending too much time travelling ? doing more work ? I don’t know. But whatever it is, I don’t like the way it is right now.

### So Scary

I am going to do something that is very scary today.

Finally, I did it. I walked straight into it and faced it. There was fear but fortunately I have friends and family who motivate me and told me to face it confidently. Trying is more important than winning.

### Memoir from Meta Refresh

My friend and I had been to [Meta Refresh](https://metarefresh.in/) ( last year, I guess ). It is a UX conference. We happened to talk to each other by writing on a notebook.

### Out of Battery

Thanks for reading. I quote verses from my favourite Tamil literature “[Tirukkuṛaḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)” at the end of my blog posts.
> # “நல்லார்கண் பட்ட வறுமையின் இன்னாதே
> # கல்லார்கண் பட்ட திரு”
> # *— திருக்குறள்*

Translated meaning ( in my words ): Wealth gained by an ignorant man causes more troubles than the poverty of a knowledgable person.
