It is the end of the year. If you are reading this, I hope that you are doing well or at least hanging in there!

So, how did 2017 go for you?

I am still not sure of how it went for me.

So, what is this post really about?

It’s a counter post for my post earlier this year, which is probably something that I did different this year.
[**Opening up**
*Am I an introvert ? I don’t know.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/opening-up-de6ab8ef25d9)

First thing was attempting to write **more blog posts**.

I think, I did good in this section. I had the chance to write 3 technical write ups and they are
[**Understanding AST for building better developer tools**
*If you had used a full fledged IDE like Visual Studio, Eclipse, Android Studio etc. you may have noticed features like…*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/understanding-ast-for-building-better-developer-tools-40a18bbbc87a)

And one day, I tried writing a log of a project that I worked on for [a game programming competition](http://js13kgames.com/)
[**Scribble**
*It’s the name of the game, I am about to develop now. Time is Sept 10, 2017 7:34 PM IST when I am starting to type this…*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/scribble-82c04fb6f7d3)

I liked the idea of logging. It made me felt more alive. It also a gave a nice feeling of making a memory of something that I did at some point.

So, I started this blog series (which I personally call the “log book”), where I author a medium post throughout the week, when I get time and note down some interesting things and release it at the end of the week. I was able to continuously log for 11 weeks ( that is 77 days ) Whoa! That’s a huge input for me. Here is the list of all the logs, that I wrote till now,
[**log 1 = 0**
*I am planning to maintain a log about various things I do in a week.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-1-0-3bb0ca07f6ab)
[**log 2 = 0.3010**
*This is my second weekly log.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-2-0-3010-96627f60c444)
[**log 3 = 0.4771**
*This is my 3rd weekly log. This is going to be a bit different, as I didn’t spend much time on tech related stuff this…*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-3-0-4771-a5384fa9975d)
[**log 4 = 0.6020**

[**log 5 = 0.6989**
*This is my fifth weekly log.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-5-0-6989-3ffa77f24c22)
[**log 6 = 0.7781**
*This is my sixth weekly log.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-6-0-7781-ac9519f90ef7)
[**log 7 = 0.8450**
*My 7th weekly log.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-7-0-8450-2cc69d84e3c8)
[**log 8 = 0.9030**
*This is my 8th weekly log.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-8-0-9030-773918bf5a)
[**log 9 = 0.9542**

[**log 10 = 1**
*My 10th weekly log*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-10-1-6d2deb1a8442)
[**log 11 = 1.0413**
*This weekly log is a bit different. Because, I am writing the entire post in the last day of the week. Usually, I write…*medium.com](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-11-1-0413-48b3ffc3110d)

It’s a big undertaking. I faced two major problems.

1. Finding time ( Busy with work, commuting and sleeping )

1. Had hard time differentiating the private-public event boundary. Is it ok to share this in public? or may be it’s a bad idea.

Unfortunately, I am stopping this!

Because?

* I prefer to write deep ( at least to a level ) summarisation of things. Like the three tech blog posts, I mentioned above.

* Most of my logs contain some technology/learnings that I came across in that week. I think, tweets and gists are the right tool for this. ( [log 11](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-11-1-0413-48b3ffc3110d) clearly proved this ). They are simple and modular for sharing information.

Do I regret it?

Definitely not! I am happy that, I made nice little memories for myself.

Am I stopping to blog?

Definitely not! I am stopping to *write logs on weekly basis.*That’s it! I might still try to log interesting events happening in life like [participating in game programming competition](http://js13kgames.com/), [visit to the place where I grew up](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-5-0-6989-3ffa77f24c22) etc.

Even though the number of blog posts are **going down, **I wish to provide more thoughtful writings and look forward for writing down more enjoyable writing experience. ( I enjoyed the time, [when I explained using MULTI EXEC in redis to implement rate limiting on a worker queue](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/redis-adventures-d981257cd9be) )

I just hope not to go down to zero!

If you are going to miss my weekly logs, don’t worry I got a nice little twitter page setup where I am already kind of active.

Other than blog posts, some other things that I mentioned there were

**Ask Me Anything **— went well, because I was asked no questions :D

**Public Talks — **Not a chance yet

**Documenting myself** — went OK, as I was able to commit few things to [https://github.com/scriptnull/scriptnull.github.io](https://github.com/scriptnull/scriptnull.github.io)

**More photos on social networks **— Well, I was thinking about this deeply. While I was writing it, my original intent was to take more pictures and collect memories. But, I am still not sure of posting it on social networks. So, I am sorry about this part, because I am really a bad photographer ( most of the photos are shaken ) and I really feel satisfied with Google Photos. My photos are not very great and they are comfortable sitting in Google Photos.

We can’t say that I didn’t do it entirely, because I shared some photos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scriptnull/media) and in my weekly logs on medium. This attempt definitely increased my sense of taking photograph for recording a right memory.

Back to my opening statement

How did go for me?

I think, I barely hanged in there.

Thanks for reading.

I wish you a productive and happy new year!
