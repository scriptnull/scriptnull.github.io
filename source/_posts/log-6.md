This is my sixth weekly log.

### Friend’s puzzle

[A friend of mine](https://github.com/argonlaser) sent me a puzzle question over telegram. It was quite interesting and I tried solving it. It felt like a classic crypto problem.

### Going dark

I am going to gradually switch to a dark theme in everything I use, as I find it more soothing. In fact, I am already typing on a dark interface in medium.

### It’s not what you read, it’s what you ignore

### Go Benchmarks in VS Code

I have been using VS Code for writing Golang for a while. Few months back, I had this feature request.
[**Ability to run Benchmarks from test file · Issue #972 · Microsoft/vscode-go**
*First of all, vscode-go is awesome. It is best workflow experience for writing go code. One of the features, I love the…*github.com](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/972)

yay! It’s going to be live on the next VS Code update.

### Keeping away

I suffered from very high eye pain during this week, which is making me to keep away from computers and thinking in general.

### The Reddit Failure

In [log 4](https://medium.com/@scriptnull/log-4-0-6020-81faf172a19d), I was excited about the launch of a new version of a [software side project](https://github.com/microplan-xyz/microplan) that me and [my friend](https://github.com/argonlaser) maintain. We tried our luck at spreading the word about it and shared on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/7bkj6u/microplan_a_command_line_tool_for_planning/). But, it was a failure. We had no response over it. I am not entirely sure of why. But, anyways if you are reading this and are trying out [microplan](https://github.com/microplan-xyz/microplan), I would love to know your feedback.

### Google Trends

After the great reddit failure, I started thinking about how successful information sharing is done on the internet. So, I decided to get some tips about it from [Pavan](https://twitter.com/Pavan_Belagatti) ( We work together at [Shippable](https://www.shippable.com/) ). He introduced me to probably one of the basic tools that I should be using while sharing something on the internet.

There are lot of factors while sharing content and some of them are,

* What am I sharing ?

* Where am I sharing ?

* When am I sharing ?

I always had the question of “Is this the right time to share on this web site ?”, because I don’t want the people who would like to read and give feedback on the content that I am sharing to be sleeping when I post it. Thanks to [Pavan](https://twitter.com/Pavan_Belagatti) for introducing me to this amazing tool.
[**Google Trends**
*See the latest trends, data and visualizations from Google. Find out what's trending near you right now.*trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com/trends/)

Wikipedia says,
> “**Google Trends** is a public web facility of [Google Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), based on [Google Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search), that shows how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.”

That’s cool. This could give us a place where traffic of site could be high. And based on the region, we could get a time to post on it. For example, I did a [google trend search on Flipkart](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=flipkart) ( Flipkart is a popular e-commerce site in India ) and google trends gives me the exact result. So, if I am writing something about Flipkart, then the right time to share it is daytime in Indian Standard Time.

### Wishlist

* Publish a clean dark theme for youtube at [https://userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/)

* Write a blog post about the implementation of horizontal scaling in a message queue software.

Thanks for reading. I quote verses from my favourite Tamil literature “[Tirukkuṛaḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)” at the end of my blog posts.
> # “பயன்தூக்கார் செய்த உதவி நயன்தூக்கின்
> # நன்மை கடலின் பெரிது”
> # *— திருக்குறள்*

Translated meaning ( in my words ): The kindness in the act of helping others without expecting anything in return is larger than the size of a sea.
