This post is inspired by [Jaseem Abid's original post](https://blog.jabid.in/2016/11/30/rejections.html) (Thanks to him). I found it helpful and motivating. Hence I am doing my version of it. Alright, so here is the idea.

> Why do we not talk about our failures?

Jaseem's original post was about a few companies that rejected him outright without even an interview. But my version would be slightly different. It will also include the roles for which I had the chance to interview with, but messed up in the interview - I hope you are entertained by these stories!

Also, quoting Jaseem one more time to state the purpose of this blog post:

> This might be the motivation someone needs to keep trying and hence I believe is worth sharing

I hope that reading this helps you a little bit in your job search! I want you to know that job search might be stressful (at times), but you got this! Prepare yourself and go out there; Don't get hurt by a rejection.

Ok, let me start the show!

## Paytm

The year was 2015. I was fresh out of college! Never applied/attended an interview before because I was not allowed to attend the campus interviews happening in college due to low marks.

So, there I was browsing through [Hasjob](https://hasjob.co/) (one of my favorite job portals) everyday. I then noticed this job listing saying that [Paytm](https://paytm.com/) is hiring for software engineers who do node.js.

I got very excited. I had started using Paytm (a digital money wallet) sometime back and was amazed by this new way of handling money.

So, I went on and just applied for it. I think this was my first ever job application.

Luckily, I got back a response. They wanted to do a phone call. I didn't even think through what they would ask in the phone. I was so happy that I was even considered for a phone call. haha :D

Then the phone call came. It was so fast - we said hi and may be a very little intro. Then this happened

interviewer: do you have a paper and pen right now?

me: no

interviewer: Ok, take those and get ready?

me: (running around to get a paper and pen) ok, got it.

interviewer: which language are you comfortable in?

me: JavaScript

interviewer: Ok, write a program to reverse a linked list.

me: (stunned, because the last time I wrote a linked list was years ago for data strucutre exam) ummmm, (tried so hard to think of a solution)

(after a few mins)

interviewer: Did you write it?

me: I just wrote the linked list structure and function signature

interviewer: never mind, just read out what you had written in the paper.

(me, reading in breaking voice)

interviewer: Kbye

Shortwhile, I called my friend who had been preparing for interviews and he introduced me to the fact that asking data structure questions is normal. That's when I got the taste of how the interviewing world is :D 

## DoSelect

It was the same year and just after the paytm rejection, I came across [DoSelect](https://doselect.com/). It is a coding assessment platform like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Those kind of sites were gaining a lot of traction at that time. Remotely executing your code and evaluating solutions from a website is pretty cool.

Earlier as a student, I released one of my successful projects called [compilex](https://github.com/scriptnull/compilex) which is a library useful for building such kind of sites. So I was so much interested in working on such a product. Hence I applied.

The first round was using the DoSelect platform itself. Simple algorithm and datastructure style questions (I think I answered 2 out of 3 correctly; the other one partially accepting soltion). They asked for a Google hangout video chat. But I had a very poor internet connection at that time and openly mailed them about it and asked if it is ok to do an in-person interview instead.

They said ok! At that time, they were based out of [InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/) office. I took a "500D" BMTC to arrive at their office (used google map to track the right bus stop, but got down early in the previous bus stop. haha). Thankfully, there are lot of 500D buses and so I hopped on the next one and arrived at the right spot. This was the first time I entered a tech park and a big office. I was WOWed!

I was nervous and thinking of what they will be asking me. There was a technical discussion. The thing that went wrong there was "I wasn't confident while telling my answer". They asked me something like "how to get realtime updates in browser?", I knew that websockets are used for them but I didn' confidently put that infront of them. I said about long polling and was a bit reluctant about starting the conversation about web sockets. Because I wasn't sure about how standard web socket approach is. So the conversation went a little bit weird.

After that I spoke with the founders. I was so naive throughout the entire conversation both in-person and mail. I was so new to a lot of things - tech, speaking with people etc. I am sure that I looked like a fool at some point in time. haha. The conversation ended in a good note. I very much appreciate their time.

Got back home. I was very happy and even naively told my grand-mother that I might be getting an offer anytime soon. We waited for their email (lol, she still keeps a check on me whenever I start job search - even after 5 years). Waited and waited.... haha. Even mailed them back 10 days after to followup. (I read through that mail to get the feel of nostalgia and how naive I was - it felt like I was so desparate for the job)

At this point, I already learnt a couple of things about job search
1. Don't be desparate. Just accept who you are and try to find people who are willing to accept who you are and help you improve.
2. Never say that you are getting an offer to others before receiving the actual offer letter. That way we avoid embrassements infront of family and friends. hahahaha.
