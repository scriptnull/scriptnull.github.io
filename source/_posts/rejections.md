This post is inspired by [Jaseem Abid's original post](https://blog.jabid.in/2016/11/30/rejections.html) (Thanks to him). I found it helpful and motivating. Hence I am doing my version of it. Alright, so here is the idea.

> Why do we not talk about our failures?

Jaseem's original post was about a few companies that rejected him outright without even an interview. But my version would be slightly different. It will also include the roles for which I had the chance to interview with, but messed up in the interview - I hope you are entertained by these stories!

Also, quoting Jaseem one more time to state the purpose of this blog post:

> This might be the motivation someone needs to keep trying and hence I believe is worth sharing

I hope that reading this helps you a little bit in your job search! I want you to know that job search might be stressful (at times), but you got this! Prepare yourself and go out there; Don't get hurt by a rejection.

Ok, let me start the show!

## Paytm

The year was 2015. I was fresh out of college! Never applied/attended an interview before because I was not allowed to attend the campus interviews happening in college due to low marks.

So, there I was browsing through [Hasjob](https://hasjob.co/) (one of my favorite job portals) everyday. I then noticed this job listing saying that [Paytm](https://paytm.com/) is hiring for software engineers who do node.js.

I got very excited. I had started using Paytm (a digital money wallet) sometime back and was amazed by this new way of handling money.

So, I went on and just applied for it. I think this was my first ever job application.

Luckily, I got back a response. They wanted to do a phone call. I didn't even think through what they would ask in the phone. I was so happy that I was even considered for a phone call. haha :D

Then the phone call came. It was so fast - we said hi and may be a very little intro. Then this happened

interviewer: do you have a paper and pen right now?

me: no

interviewer: Ok, take those and get ready?

me: (running around to get a paper and pen) ok, got it.

interviewer: which language are you comfortable in?

me: JavaScript

interviewer: Ok, write a program to reverse a linked list.

me: (stunned, because the last time I wrote a linked list was years ago for data strucutre exam) ummmm, (tried so hard to think of a solution)

(after a few mins)

interviewer: Did you write it?

me: I just wrote the linked list structure and function signature

interviewer: never mind, just read out what you had written in the paper.

(me, reading in breaking voice)

interviewer: Kbye

[Ghosted && Rejected]

Shortwhile, I called my friend who had been preparing for interviews and he introduced me to the fact that asking data structure questions is normal. That's when I got the taste of how the interviewing world is :D
