This saturday I had the chance to tick off one of the items from my wishlist - "Give a tech talk in a conference".

One of the most pivotal points in my careers is getting a free ticket to attend a JavaScript conference called [JSFoo](https://jsfoo.in/2015/) back in 2015. I enjoyed and still enjoy watching conference talks like JSConf, GopherCon etc. for hours. They bring in new perspective, teach something new, help discover awesome people to follow etc. - Also many thanks to conferences that upload their recording for free on YouTube. I am not sure if you know the consequences of those free videos - they literally helped me build a career :D

(alright, back to the topic)

I don't usually speak up much in real-life. But I recently felt that I haven't been speaking up much about what I am busy doing at work and also some new perspective on CI/CD pipelines.

At the same time, I discovered that GitHub Satellite conference is happening soon and CFPs are open for it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GitHub Satellite is coming to India (well, virtually)!üéâ<br>We want to hear your stories about open source, secure development &amp; DevOps.<br>Submit a proposal to speak at GitHub Satellite India 2021 on March 26-27.<a href="https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh">https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/N4Nxp28rHE">pic.twitter.com/N4Nxp28rHE</a></p>&mdash; GitHubIndia (@GitHubIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia/status/1358001577110368256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then striked the thought: May be I should give a talk because I am kind of doing some cool devops stuff with GitHub Actions at work. May be share about it?

So I headed to #conference channel in our work slack and told that I am planning to write a CFP for the conference and got help in reviewing my CFP. Waited curiously after submitting CFP in a few days because I did it for the first time ever.

Then came the mail.

Got excited so excited at this point :)

Within somedays the conference website was up - https://githubsatellite.com

Got even more excited after seeing these :D At this point, I still haven't written down my talk yet. But passively brainstorming what to share in the talk here and there.

The conference is virtual - this kind of helped because I am kind of shy, nervous and have definitely have stage fear :D The fact that the conference is virutal gave me a low barrier to entry. Shifted my mindset to it is going to be like being on zoom call with a co-worker where I am explaining stuff.

I have found a useful approach to doing new stuff. It is called https://ted.com - Whenever I am trying to do something new I try to browse this website for videos dealing with the new stuff. In this case it is "public speaking". Guess what there is a playlist that I needed: [Before public speaking](https://www.ted.com/playlists/226/before_public_speaking)

(binge watched)

I really liked this video called [Talk nerdy to me](https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me?referrer=playlist-before_public_speaking) in that playlist. It helped in removing my shyness. One other idea that got from that playlist is "talks are essentially idea transferring methodology". If we had an elegant idea about something that the world, we shouldn't care about silly things like shyness to stop others from acquiring that idea :D

In the meantime came the speaker kit from GitHub! They comfortably stocked my with all gadgets that I need for the tech talk.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GitHubIndia</a> for these lovely gadgets. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>Deploying them to my desk is the first thing I want to do this weekend üòÄüë®‚Äçüíª <a href="https://t.co/0r3PyxCeLu">pic.twitter.com/0r3PyxCeLu</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1372945054243774467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a></blockquote>

It wow-ed everyone around. Happens everytime I receive free goodies :D
