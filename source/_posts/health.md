_This blog post is the first part of a blog series named [The Imaginary Company](/blog/the-imaginary-company)_

Among all the things you have and you think is powerful, the supreme is your health. That determines your very existence.

Quoting a tweet that I remember from some time back.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Falling sick reminds you that the largest competitive advantage you can have is being healthy.</p>&mdash; Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1203892455948476416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2019</a></blockquote>

Health comes first. Over everything and anything. This is the reason why this is the first post in this blog series.

## Stay healthy

I am here to beg you. You heard it right!

I am here to beg you to close your damn digital devices and take a break/nap/sleep/leave/vacation when you have to.

Working up late or in normal hours? and feeling very tired? head-ache? stomach-ache? burning sensation in eyes?

Please stop working! I beg you to take a break/nap/sleep/leave/vacation.

Whatever you are doing isn't as important as your health. So I beg you to step away a little bit and stay healthy.

## Insurance

In a world where epidemics and pandemics come and go, the need to be prepared for something bad is essential.

I think the first line of defence is getting a health insurance. A few of us may not be very aware of the importance of it; mostly the new grads -- look at me, I was not aware of the importance until 2 to 3 years after graduating.

In case if you are not aware of what this is. It's an insurance which will pay your (and your family's) medical bills if you/your dependents are hospitalized.

In today's world, some companies get their employees a health insurance and some don't.

As far as I know, the companies that give the health insurance to employees tend to revoke the insurance during the immediate month in which the employee terminates their employment.

Ok, don't want to sound pessimistic, but what happens if the employee gets sick and hospitalized before getting into his next job and just after leaving the current job.

Won't you feel that if a co-worker (well, an ex-co-worker) who you had been collaborating for years is stuck in a situation like this and couldn't afford to pay medical bills?

Well, I will feel for sure; if I come to know of. Paying bills is debt. When people feel sick, this is the least thing not to be cared of. But most people tend to worry about it. Well, because it is a debt.

So this is the least we can do to avoid a worry during tough times.

That is why, I am proposing a plan below. Not proposing, but dictating; because this of that much importance to the people we care about.

Hijacking a bit here for a casual career advice/pointer: About the companies that don't provide a medical insurance; get insurance on your own. Double think before joining them. Either they don't have the money to afford the insurance for every employee or just don't want to do it. If they don't have the money to afford it, then they might soon not have the money to afford you too. So better evaluate what is in the game.

## The plan

Everyone who joins the company, gets a health insurance -- This is expected!

This health insurance will be a maximum affordable insurance plan by the company and will cover

1. The employee
2. Spouse
3. Children
4. Parents

I think most insurance plan allows any four of them. We will try to get for all of them, but at least 4 people should be covered.

This health insurance will cover upto 1 year from the date of joining. Even if you leave in 3 months or the next day. Just consider it like a gift for taking time to interview with us and trusting enough to join us.

The same insurance will be renewed (for another 1 year) by the company if you are staying in the company at the time of renewal && the company still exists :)

I wish that the imaginary company can do this consistently for everyone in the company. Again not a mere wish, it must happen. Everyone in the company needs to be cared enough and given the first line of defence.

Submitting your insurance details even before the payroll details is how things work here.

Afterall this is the first!
