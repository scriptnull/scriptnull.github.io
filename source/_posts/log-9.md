### aws.training

I used to use [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) a lot. But haven’t been interested in taking a course on it in the past 2 years. Now, I have a new interest. It’s AWS.

Luckily AWS is having a similar site. I am very excited to start learning from it.

*X AWS Training has a new learning management system. This new system will make it easier for you to find and manage…*www.aws.training](https://www.aws.training/)

### Apache Hadoop

As the result of AWS training, I discovered this wonderful technology called Apache Hadoop. It is used for processing large amount of data. It is organised in a nice way with components such as HDFS ( Hadoop Distributed File System ), YARN etc. and the concepts I learnt seemed to do pretty powerful task.

This is probably the answer for a Big data question [my friend](https://github.com/argonlaser) and I tried to solve few years back when we were in college. We had no clue of Hadoop and wrote cute little Java and C# programs to parse GBs of data :D

I am very much interested in seeing it in action

### 100 days of Code
[**#100DaysOfCode**

I came across the 100 days of code challenge. Actually, I have been seeing lot of #100DaysOfCode tweets lately, but didn’t know the fact that it was challenge.

I am not yet sure if I should take it on!

### One more scary thing

Last week, I mentioned that I did something so scary to me. Well, boy that was a success. Now, I am getting ready to do one more scary thing which is more of a continuation of what I did last week. It’s getting so cold out here.

I am expecting this to be a failure. Let me wait and see.

### Rough Days

Things have been a little rough lately for me and I am feeling down. I think, I am just tired and not able to digest the way I spend my time.

### Repeating the verses

I quote verses from my favourite Tamil literature “[Tirukkuṛaḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)” at the end of all my blog posts. I have been doing it for quite sometime and I guess, I would like to repeat the same verses that I wrote till now. I am doing this because, I want these principles to help me and get to my mind, when I need them the most. Currently, I am forgetting a lot of things and I think repeating will help my mind.

I am planning on a series of short technical blog posts, more like my study notes and I would like to scope adding verses to only the log posts, as I want the technical posts to be straight forward.

### Wishlist

* Try to parse large amount of data with Apache Hadoop

Thanks for reading. I quote verses from my favourite Tamil literature “[Tirukkuṛaḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)” at the end of my log posts.
