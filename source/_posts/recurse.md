I am happy to announce that I got accepted into [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) center for the Fall 1 '20 batch. It's quite a life event because attending RC was one of my dreams for about an year and a half now.

Trying to share a few things about my journey.

## What is RC?
For those who haven't heard of it yet:

> The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City and currently operating online.

Retreats happen in batches and there are two types of batches: Full (12 weeks) and Mini (1 week). It is self-directed, so we pick what to learn during that time. We  will be working along-side a [diverse](https://www.recurse.com/diversity) group of people, so there is much to learn from them.

I won't steal the fun of knowing about RC for the first time from you! haha, When I heard of RC for the first time - I spent like an hour reading all their contents at https://www.recurse.com - so go ahead and enjoy the link!

## Why is it a dream?
I mentioned earlier that it has been a dream of mine to attend the RC. Why so?

RC has a nice application/interview process (you should totally apply if you are in doubt). Eventhough I clear the interviews, there were still uncertainities luriking in and the odds of me getting a chance to attend it was very low. I will tell you why!

First one is financial situations: Had been a software engineer for the past 5 years and always had the commitment to go to work! With the [current pandemic situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), I lost my job 2 months back and got moratorium for EMIs of loan repayment. So the stress about "have to go to work to pay loans" is not there for months. Which means, I can really do whatever I like to do right now! Just have to make sure that I figure out a way to make money before I spend all the money I have.

Apart from that, I have very little chances of affording travel + accomodation in USA. Flight tickets, cost of living there for 12 weeks. Probably I would have to get a loan or sponsorship to be able to afford it or at least have to save up for year(s) to be able to do it! (Just see the conversion rate of INR to USD). Now that the batches are online, it is totally affordable!

Next uncertainity is travel visa - I don't know much about it, because I haven't travelled much! (know what I have never visited North India itself, haha). In one of my previous jobs, most of my team people flew from Bangalore to Delhi for getting a travel visa to a place for attending the annual meetup of the company, guess what - not a single person got the visa (except the ones who had already visited some countries). I remember reading that Daniel (the creator of curl) has a live timer counting the time since he applied for a visa; if you are wondering, the timer [is still running](https://daniel.haxx.se/us-visa.html). Since we have people already attend RC from India before, so it is not a complete impossibility but I guess it could still be a road block. Now that RC is running online, the visa I need is here - my internet connection, haha.

Clearing the interview and overcoming all these uncertainities should happen in an aligned timeline. (not trying to scare you off from applying, but these are just some things that I thought might be a problem for me personally. Despite that I was hoping to attend RC somehow even when they were running only physical batches. Hope is a beautiful thing - have it!)

So that makes it seem like attending RC is almost a dream for me and as [my friend](https://twitter.com/riturajcse) said over a Whatsapp text

> Dreams do come true

## First attempt

My first attempt to apply to RC dates back to the end of 2018. I got so excited to apply for it that I started writing a lisp parse ( https://github.com/scriptnull/yali ) inspired by a task in their [pair programming tasks](https://www.recurse.com/pairing-tasks). I had started filling [the written application for RC](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat) a couple of times and I would stop right after "Code CracklePop". When I want to get back to it, life happened - like one of my employer getting acquired by another company and there is no way to take a sabattical right after it.
