Good morning! (It's 06:35 here) I happened to pick up a book about personal finance and read through a few pages of it in the past hour.

I have always felt to be lacking in knowledge about money. So, this is just my attempt at getting better at it a little bit.

My limited knowledge on personal finance is mostly by reading a few chapters in [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/) (amazing resource, thanks to the people creating it). This time, I have picked up this book called [Let's talk money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499078-let-s-talk-money). I picked it mostly because I somehow got this book recommendation from a trusted source and the book deals with money in INR (Indian rupee) - makes sure that things discussed in the book are applicable in India.

So what is this blog post about?

well, I am planning to note down one or two things that I find interesting about personal finance here. So, in the attempt of that - I will start.

I learned something that I am going to describe below just by reading the preface of the book. LOL, the book is starting to pay off already?

It is this concept called FOIR. It stands for _Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio_.

I think this is a very good place to start evaluating how we are doing financially. Fixed obligation - is the fixed installments of money that you must be paying every month. Example: EMIs of bank loans. If we ratio that to the monthly income, then boom! we have a number that could tell how a person is doing financially now.

Let's take the math-y approach and start with the formula.

FOIR = total monthly EMIs / monthly income

If a person is earning 1,00,000 INR per month and they are just paying an EMI of 30,000 INR, then their FOIR is 30%

The book's author says that a FOIR of 30% is healthy for an individual.

Something interesting happened while I googled FOIR to copy-paste the full form of FOIR (haha, I don't want to be embarrassed for spelling "obligations" wrongly)

Ok, here is the interesting fact: FOIR is being used by banks to decide loan eligibility for an individual.

So, it seems like the banks expect a FOIR of less than 50% for a person to be eligible for a loan. (as simple as it is!)
